# Programmes for SEC Practicals Batch-A for FYBScIT
Hello I'm Ian and I'm a professional idiot please follow this repository your own risk.  
I have made this repository to keep track of the programmes done in the SEC practical classes for Batch-A.

These programmes are to be written in the journal by everyone so feel free to refer.  
Try to use these programmes as reference and do the problems on your own.

You can checkout [Abhinav's Notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10ytSR8hGNstQpv7pIpamNu_5iMYAGXDK) for a scanned pdf copy of the Journal and notes of other subjects as well  
*Thanks Abhinav <3*

I'll be updating this repository as more practicals happen, so you can star or bookmark this repo and checkin for the programs

Thanks :D
